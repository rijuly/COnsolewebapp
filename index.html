            <h2>Introduction to visual studio coding</h2>
            <p>Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE)
                 developed by Microsoft to develop GUI (Graphical User Interface), console,
                  Web applications, web apps, mobile apps, cloud, and web serv ices, etc.
                   With the help of this IDE, you can create managed code as well as
                    native code. It uses the various platforms of Microsoft software
                     development software like Windows store, Microsoft S ilverlight,
                      and Windows API, etc. It is not a language-specific IDE as you
                       can use this to write code in C#, C++, VB(Visual Basic), Python,
                        JavaScript, and many more languages.
